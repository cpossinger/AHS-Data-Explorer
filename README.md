# AHS-Data-Explorer
Data Explorer for the [Adventist Health Study](https://adventisthealthstudy.org) 

This Data Explorer contains various tables and simple visualizations that allow researchers the ability to dive deep into their questionnaire and resulting data without code. Using the RShiny package we were able to manipulate the DOM to allow for interactive tables and visualizations to provide a more effective user experience.
